3 ways to process upstream events (task 1 / task 2):

1) single SlidingWindow: 
	- computation overhead (computes similarity & all 4 times)
2) double window (1h tumbling + 4h sliding): 
	- communication overhead (sends huge HashMaps over the network at once)
3) single processFunction: manually looks at watermarks & manages the data on it's own (in HashMap)
	- parallelization is only possible by key - if a worker responsible for a key is slow, the whole computation is slow


We added UK - England dependency
People live in the UK but when they send a post it has a location England. (no events come in the UK)
But England and UK are not connected apart from that they both reside in Europe. 
That's why we connected them (Fraud detection)

Differences:
- Fraud was easier than expected
